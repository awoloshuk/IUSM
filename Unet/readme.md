# Implementing unet in pytorch
# Database
Epithelium database and code from from: http://www.andrewjanowczyk.com/deep-learning/

# Training
* trained using google VM on Kesla T80 took ~30 minutes for 100 epochs
* Best test loss 0.1131
* Training parameters can be seen in train-2.py

# Results
Attached are some screenshots of the output, showing the input image, output, mask, and also a series of images representing different layer activations
